		<h1>Audio Streaming with WebRTC</h1>
		<h2>What does this do?</h2>
		<p>
			This demonstrates a audio transmission using WebRTC between the two browsers.
			Instead of using micrphones, server side browser reads a MP3 file, trannsfer it
			to the client using WebRTC, then the client playbacks the audio.
		</p>
		<h2>How to run?</h2>
		<p>
			Click the links below to open server tab and client tab. By design, the client
			will become the oferrer (initiator).
		</p>
		<p>
			In the client page, you will see the first "offer" message in the text box. Copy
			the text to the sever side input box, then hit "OK". You will see "answer" message
			appears in the text box below. Copy the text then paste it to the client side
			input box.
		</p>
		<p>
		  Reeapt the above, until it stops showing a new text. On success, you should
			start hearing a sound played on the client side browser.
		</p>
		<h2>Let's get start</h2>
